**wash** is the comprehensive command-line tool for developing, building, and managing WebAssembly components. It provides an intuitive developer experience for the modern Wasm ecosystem, from project scaffolding to building and pushing components to OCI registries.

## Features

- **Project Creation**: Generate new WebAssembly component projects from templates
- **Multi-Language Build System**: Compile components for multiple languages (Rust, Go, TypeScript)
- **Development Loop**: Built-in hot-reload development server (`wash dev`)
- **OCI Registry Integration**: Push and pull components to/from OCI-compatible registries
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture with WebAssembly-based plugins
- **Component Inspection**: Analyze component WIT interfaces and metadata
- **Environment Health Checks**: Built-in diagnostics and system verification
- **Configuration Management**: Hierarchical configuration with global and project-level settings
- **Self-Updates**: Keep wash up-to-date with the latest features and fixes

### Plugin Commands

wash also supports custom commands through its plugin system. Plugins are automatically discovered and made available as subcommands.

## Plugin System

wash features an extensible plugin architecture built on WebAssembly:

- **Built-in Plugins**: oauth, blobstore-filesystem, aspire-otel
- **Platform Integration**: Plugins can integrate wash with specific platforms (like wasmCloud)
- **Custom Plugins**: Write your own plugins using the WebAssembly Component Model
- **Automatic Discovery**: Plugins in the `plugins/` directory are automatically loaded
- **Hook System**: Plugins can register pre and post-command hooks for workflow customization

Use `wash plugin --help` to see plugin management commands.

### Shell Completion

#### Zsh

For zsh completion, please run:

```shell
mkdir -p ~/.zsh/completion
wash completion zsh > ~/.zsh/completion/_wash
```

and put the following in `~/.zshrc`:

```shell
fpath=(~/.zsh/completion $fpath)
```

Note if you're not running a distribution like oh-my-zsh you may first have to enable autocompletion (and put in `~/.zshrc` to make it persistent):

```shell
autoload -Uz compinit && compinit
```

#### Bash

To enable bash completion, run the following, or put it in `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile`:

```shell
. <(wash completion bash)
```

#### Fish

The below commands can be used for fish auto completion:

```shell
mkdir -p ~/.config/fish/completions
wash completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/wash.fish
```

#### Powershell

The below command can be referred for setting it up. Please note that the path might be different depending on your
system settings.

```shell
wash completion powershell > $env:UserProfile\\Documents\\WindowsPowerShell\\Scripts\\wash.ps1
```

## Architecture

wash is built with the following key principles:

- **Component-First**: Native support for the WebAssembly Component Model
- **Language Agnostic**: Support for Rust, Go (TinyGo), TypeScript, and more
- **OCI Compatible**: Components are stored and distributed using OCI registries
- **Portable Components**: Produces WebAssembly components that are runtime-agnostic and compatible with any Component Model runtime
- **Wasmtime-Powered**: Uses Wasmtime for local component execution and development workflows
- **Extensible**: Plugin system allows integration with different platforms and workflows
- **Developer Experience**: Hot-reload development loops and comprehensive tooling
